# push_rust

This is the same project with the same rules as [push_swap](https://github.com/n0bits/push_swap).

## Why doing a project that I have already done?

Well, it is fun! isn't it?

I wanted to learn more about rust but didn't want to think about solving a problem, and I have had quite 
fun with push swap ngl, I wanted to just learn rust syntax and methodology, so I picked this fun project.

## Algorithm:

For now, it just solves 3 number, but I will probably think about picking another sorting algorithm.

## Run:

```bash
    cargo run 3 1 2
```
